## About

AIchemy is a UK hub with an interdisciplinary leadership team from Imperial College London, University of Liverpool, University of Cambridge and University of Southampton.
Our mission is to transform the Chemistry-AI interface through world-leading research and catalyse the adoption of AI in experimental and computational chemistry.

The Hubâ€™s focus spans molecules through materials to devices, reflecting the broad cross-sector need for AI in the UK chemical and chemical-related sectors.
