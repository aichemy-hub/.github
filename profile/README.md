# AIChemy Hub GitHub Organisation

## Hi there ğŸ‘‹

Welcome to the AIChemy Hub GitHub organisaton!

## About

AIchemy is a UK hub with an interdisciplinary leadership team from Imperial College London, University of Liverpool, University of Cambridge and University of Southampton.
Our mission is to transform the Chemistry-AI interface through world-leading research and catalyse the adoption of AI in experimental and computational chemistry.

The Hubâ€™s focus spans molecules through materials to devices, reflecting the broad cross-sector need for AI in the UK chemical and chemical-related sectors.

## Active Software Projects

The AIchemy research projects use and develop a wide range of software, which are too numerous to list here. 

Below are the key software and computing infrastructure projects we are activley developing on at Imperial College, some of which span multiple research areas.
